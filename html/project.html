            <p style="text-align: center;">
                Treaty One, <span style="color: red;">signed on August 3, 1871.</span> near the Red River in Manitoba, was the first of the numbered treaties 
                between the Canadian government and Indigenous nations, including the Anishinaabe and Swampy Cree. 
                It involved the cession of significant land in exchange for promises of reserves,
                annual payments, and goods such as agricultural implements and education.
                This treaty significantly impacted Indigenous communities, altering traditional ways of life
                and governance while raising ongoing issues regarding the fulfillment of treaty promises and the recognition of Indigenous rights.
                Today, Treaty One remains a foundational document in discussions about reconciliation and the relationship between Indigenous peoples and the Canadian government.

            <p id="t2">The Treaty included provisions for land allocation, <br>rights to hunt and fish, and commitments to education<br>
                and health care. What sets this Treaty apart is its unique <br>provisions and possibly more inclusive negotiation <br> compared to others. Today, it is implemented through urban reserves <br>like
                 Kapyong and economic initiatives that promote self-sufficiency and community<br> development in Treaty communities.</p>
